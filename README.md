# Autonomous Drone Path Planning 🚁✨

This project demonstrates a lightweight, **bare-metal C++** autonomous drone system capable of real-time perception, planning, and control—WITHOUT ROS! 🛠️✨

### Features:
- Modular architecture 🤝
- Real-time LIDAR integration 🚀
- Dynamic obstacle avoidance 🛑↔️
- Fast, smooth trajectory execution 🚀💨
- Auto re-planning in changing environments 🔄🌱
- Logging and debug console output 📊📝

### Technologies:
- C++17 🧑‍💻
- MAVSDK for flight control 🎮
- PCL for point cloud processing 🌐
- Eigen for linear algebra 📐
- Gazebo for simulation 🖥️🔧

**This system is designed for simulation but adaptable for real hardware deployment!** 🛸

### Quick Start:
Clone & set up the repo, then follow setup instructions in `SETUP.md`. Demo videos and detailed architecture are in `docs/`. 🚧🎥
